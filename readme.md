# B555 - Machine-Learning

B555 (Machine Learning) is one of the challenging courses at Indiana University, Bloomington. It deals with mathematical approaches to machine learning algorithms.

This course has given me exposure to the low-level functionality of an algorithm, loss functions, kernels, and their implementations from scratch in Python.

The projects shared here are a few such implementations which I have worked on during the course.

**ProgrammingProject1:** Unigram Model

**ProgrammingProject2:** Bayesian Linear Regression

**ProgrammingProject3:** Linear Classification Models

**ProgrammingProject4:** Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
