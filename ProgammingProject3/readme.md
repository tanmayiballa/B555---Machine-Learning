# Programming Project - 3
### Author: Tanmayi Balla


### Installing the required packages


```yml
# Install pandas

pip install pandas

# Install matplotlib

pip install matplotlib

# Install numpy

pip install numpy

# Install Tabulate

pip install tabulate

# Install datetime

pip install datetime
```

## Task-1:
```yml
python task1.py
```
The required output is printed in the terminal. 
Also the error plots for Generative & Bayesian Logistic Regression models for all 3 datasets are saved in the current directory with names "Task1_A.png", "Task1_B.png", and "Task1_USPS.png".


## Task-2:

```yml
python task2.py
```

The required output is printed in the terminal. The plots for error vs time, for Newton's and Gradience Ascent,for both the datasets, are saved in the same directory, with names "Task2_A.png" and "Task2_USPS.png".


### Note:
These Python files were tested in PyCharm in MAC.
Tabulate package is used to display the required output in the terminal.
It is assumed that the packages: math, and warnings are generally pre-installed. In case they are not, kindly install them before testing the code.
