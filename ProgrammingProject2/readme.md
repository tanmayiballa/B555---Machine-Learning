# Programming Project - 2
### Author: Tanmayi Balla


### Installing the required packages


```yml
# Install pandas

pip install pandas

# Install matplotlib

pip install matplotlib

# Install numpy

pip install numpy

# Install Tabulate

pip install tabulate
```

## Task-1:
```yml
python Task1.py
```
The required output is printed in the terminal. 
Also the plots for the training and test set perplexities are saved in the current directory with names "Task_1b.png", "Task1c_1.0.png", "Task1c_33.0.png", "Task1c_100.0.png", and "Task1c_1000.png".


## Task-2:

```yml
python Task2.py
```

The required output is printed in the terminal. The log evidences and MSE values for ML & Bayesian Algorithms are saved in the current directory with names "Task-2_F3.png", and "Task-2_F5.png".


### Note:
These Python files were tested in PyCharm in MAC.
Tabulate package is used to display the required output in the terminal.
It is assumed that the packages: math, random, os, and warnings are generally pre-installed. In case they are not, kindly install them before testing the code.
