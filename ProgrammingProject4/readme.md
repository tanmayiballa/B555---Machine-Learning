# Programming Project - 4
### Author: Tanmayi Balla


### Installing the required packages


```yml
# Install pandas

pip install pandas

# Install matplotlib

pip install matplotlib

# Install numpy

pip install numpy

# Install datetime

pip install datetime

It is assumed that the packages: math, random, and warnings are generally pre-installed. In case they are not, kindly install them before testing the code.

```

## Task-1:
```yml
python task1.py
```
The required output is printed in the terminal. 
Top 5 words for each topic are saved in the same directory, with name 'topicwords.csv'.
The feature list is stored as 'f1.npy', which is later used by Task-2 for classification.

## Task-2:

```yml
python task2.py
```

The required output is printed in the terminal. The plots for error vs training size, for LDA and Bag-of-words, for the newsgroups dataset, are saved in the same directory, with name "Task2.png".
This imports the 'f1.npy' file stored from the previous task. 


### Note:
These Python files were tested in PyCharm in MAC.
Tabulate package is used to display the required output in the terminal.
It is assumed that the packages: math, random, and warnings are generally pre-installed. In case they are not, kindly install them before testing the code.
